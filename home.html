		<p>"Hi there! My name is Kathryne Thompson but I go by KT. I am currently a student at the University of Texas at Austin coding bootcamp. I am currently studying development but my primary professional goal is to become a software or electromechanical engineer. I've always been passionate about computers and technology since a very early age. My primary hobby is building computers. Although I love building, taking apart, and rebuilding computers...it tends to become an extremely expensive hobby after a while. So why not make a career out of it? After years of learning the ins and outs of hardware I wanted to dive into the intermediate behind the scenes aspect of how the computer itself runs...cue development."

		<p>"I don't look like your typical computer geek...its the only thing I've ever truly excelled at. I hope to surpass boundaries and change the game. Not only for myself, female engineers, but everyone in the IT field."
