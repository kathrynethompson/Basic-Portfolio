		<p>Hi there! My name is Kathryne Thompson but you can call me KT. I'm originally from Dallas, Texas but I relocated to Austin 4 years ago to pursue my dream of becoming a software engineer. I build computers as a very expensive hobby, so you can say hardware is my forte. I am currently studying to be a web developer through the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp. I hope my well-rounded knowledge in computer systems will lead me to a very rewarding career in IT.</p>
